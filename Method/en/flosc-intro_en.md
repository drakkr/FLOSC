# Introduction

Evaluating the complexity of a piece of software is a well-known problem in software engineering. Several methods have been proposed, from just counting lines of code to more sophisticated approaches like the functions points.

We propose an intermediary method between these to extremes in order to have a simple approach, that allows tools to be build upon it and that is well suited to the nature of free and open source software.

The function points measure the size of an application by counting the functionalities provided to the users or to other applications as well as the processed data. This measurement is based on functional specifications and on logical data modeling.

The concepts of this method are based on the function point that is a unit of measurement to express the amount of business functionality an information system provides to users. It is a reference software measurement unit. It allows to determine the functional size of an application, based on the functionality provided to users, regardless of the techniques used to operate the system.

The ISO normalized standard IFPUG^[<http://www.ifpug.org>] (_International Function Point Users Group_) has notably been selected by Atos to analyze its projects with functions points.
